Project Overview

The main objective of the Big Mart Sales Prediction project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the sales of products in Big Mart stores. Accurate sales predictions can help the store optimize inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at above. It contains historical sales data from various Big Mart stores. The dataset includes information about different products, their attributes, store details, and sales information. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.
Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: git clone
    Navigate to the project directory: cd big-mart-sales-prediction
    Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preprocessing: Run the data preprocessing scripts to clean and preprocess the dataset. This might involve handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.

    Model Training: Train the sales prediction model using the preprocessed data. The model can be trained using various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting.

    Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on the test dataset. The predictions can be used to evaluate the model's performance and generate insights.
